//! Building a Cloudflare runtime: the services, both config surfaces, and the
//! three post-build funnels.
//!
//! [`build_runtime`] wires this request's D1/KV/R2/crypto/network/logger
//! services into an `ImpresspressBuilder`, hands both config surfaces over in
//! one `RuntimeConfig::install` call, runs the consumer's registrations and
//! returns a [`BuiltRuntime`] — built, but neither sealed nor booted.
//!
//! Sealing and booting is `impresspress_core::builder::boot`, reached through
//! exactly three named funnels, one per Cloudflare path:
//! [`boot_deploy_runtime`], [`boot_dynamic_request_runtime`] and
//! [`boot_prepared_runtime`]. They differ in where WRAP grants come from, which
//! `BootHooks` impl runs, and which `InitPolicy` applies; each says why at its
//! own definition. Picking a funnel is picking a function, never composing a
//! `(grants, hooks, policy)` triple at a call site — the three paths are not
//! interchangeable.
