//! Interrupt-safe containers for isolate-lifetime state.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! On a request-isolated platform (Cloudflare Workers, and any other host
//! that can stop a guest mid-execution) a request can be **hard-terminated**
//! — for exceeding its CPU allowance, or because the host tore down its I/O
//! context. That termination is not a Rust unwind: **no destructor runs.**
//! `runtime_cache`'s `BUILD_LEASE_MS` already encodes this fact for a
//! `Cell<bool>`:
//!
//! > Normal Rust cancellation drops `BuildGuard`, but Cloudflare can
//! > hard-stop a request after it exceeds its CPU allowance. That
//! > termination does not guarantee Rust destructors run, so a plain boolean
//! > can remain set forever.
//!
//! A [`RefCell`](std::cell::RefCell) is the same hazard with a far worse
//! failure mode. Its borrow flag is released by `Ref`/`RefMut::drop`. If a
//! request is hard-stopped between `borrow_mut()` and the end of that
//! borrow's scope, **the flag stays set for the life of the isolate**, and
//! every later request that touches the same cell panics. Under
//! `panic = "abort"` (which every wasm32 build of this workspace uses) a
//! panic is a `unreachable` trap taken *inside* the future's `poll`. The
//! host's response promise is then never settled and never rejected, which
//! Cloudflare reports as:
//!
//! ```text
//! The Workers runtime canceled this request because it detected that your
//! Worker's code had hung and would never generate a response.
//! ```
//!
//! with zero recorded CPU, because the victim request had barely started.
//! One stranded borrow therefore converts a single recoverable CPU
//! termination into an isolate that answers nothing until it is evicted.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! Isolate-lifetime state reachable from the request path must not sit
//! behind a fallible borrow flag, and its critical section must contain only
//! infallible O(1) moves — never a caller-supplied closure, never
//! deserialization, never hashing.
//!
//! [`IsolateCell`] enforces both. It is built on [`Cell`], which has no
//! borrow state at all, so there is nothing an interrupted holder can
//! strand. Its critical sections are `take` → move → `set`; the worst a
//! hard stop inside one can do is *lose the cached value*, which every
//! caller already handles (it is indistinguishable from a cold isolate) and
//! which self-heals on the next successful store.
//!
//! [`IdentityCache`] layers the one shared usage pattern on top: a
//! single-entry, content-keyed cache whose expensive producer runs
//! **outside** the critical section.
